/**

[Approach]: Cycle Decomposition
    This is a classic problem in sorting theory:
    Given an array of n elements, the minimum number of swaps required to sort it is equal to the sum of (cycle size - 1) over all cycles in the permutation.

ðŸ§  Intuition:
    Each cycle in the unsorted array can be sorted using cycle_size - 1 swaps.
    The total minimum swaps is the sum of all such cycle costs.

ðŸ”§ Steps:
    1. Create a vector of pairs {value, original_index}.

    2. Sort this vector by value to get the desired final position.

    3. Traverse each element; if it's not visited and not in the right place, follow the cycle.

    4.  Count how many elements are in the cycle and add cycle_size - 1 to the result.
